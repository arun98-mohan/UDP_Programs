# UDP_Programs
Questions:
1) Write a Simple Client Server Program which demonstrates the use of Datagram Sockets. CLient Application sends Datagram Packets to Server when it starts and stops. The Server Application listens on UDP Port 5000. Server on receining Datagram Packet, displays the message in the datagram on the Screen.

2) Write a Client Server Applicatio to do: a) Program Uses Datagram to send packets of information between Client application and Server Application. On Client- User types a message and the message is sent to server in Datagram Packets, The server receives the packets and displays the information in it. Then it echoes it back to the client and client displays the message in the packet.

3) Write a Java class which provides a reliable one-way Communication over UDP. Therfore, it has a method for sending Datagram Packets which can realise that a packet is lost and resend the packet in order. The Server has a method for receiving datagram packets which sends acknowledgement to sender and filters out wrongly resent packets.
